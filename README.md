# Brewblox Automation UI

The Brewblox automation service is deprecated, and will see no further development.

We don't want to pull the rug from underneath the users that were already using it,
but also don't want to include it (and its rather heavy dependencies) in the Vue 3 rewrite.

The solution is to fork the UI, and remove everything not directly relevant to the automation editor.
Users can access the automation editor at `/automation-ui`.
